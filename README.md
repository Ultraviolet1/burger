# Eat-Da-Burger App
## This is an application using Node.js, Express, and Handlebars
### This burger logger was created with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM.  Node and MySQL were used to query and route data in this app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

### The Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the page-- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
